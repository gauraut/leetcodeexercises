This repository contains the codes I wrote to complete some interesting problems on leetcode. I like practicing on leetcode. It makes me feel good and write codes more efficiently.

1. For each problem directory, there's a "Problem Description.txt" file which describes the problem.

2. The "(Problem Name) Solution.cpp" file has the function in the class 'solution' to solve the problem. This functions were completed by me. The leetcode format imports the specific STL based on the function called. For example, if the pow() function is used, it includes the 'cmath' header file automatically. Also, the main function which runs the code on many test cases is hidden. Although, all the above codes work! Some are even the fastest ever on leetcode(ofcourse they used more memory but hey, where can there not be tradeoffs :) ).

Thank You for reading!
